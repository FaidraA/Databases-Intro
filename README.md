This is the repository for the class Introduction to Databases. We created a database and a website to help manage the clients of a fictional hotel (more details about what exactly we were asked to do in project_2021_final.pdf).

Collaboration with Dimitris Liberopoulos (the web design part - front end, https://github.com/Jimlibo)
